I want to say that no one has any idea how incredible this announcement will be.  Call this hype... please.  I am quite sure that the announcement will be called a &quot;scam&quot;.  Should be a lot of fun to hear the reactions.  I can't wait.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>There is a lot of info coming early in November, but I thought until that time I might &quot;leak&quot; some info along the way.<br />
<br />
1st piece of news is that the target startup time for both models is... drum roll, please... 2 seconds.<br />
<br />
Owning a RED ONE will be of great importance as we move forward.<br />
<br />
That's all for now.<br />

<br />
Be very careful with your spending.  The world is in financial turmoil right now.  I strongly recommend that you take care of your personal finances and tighten your belts.<br />
<br />
If you can make a purchase that can make you some money, buy it.  If you are considering making a purchase &quot;just because&quot;... please think twice.<br />
<br />
Our customers are important to us.  But not at the expense of their financial safety.  We view RED as a long term partnership with our customers.  Not a quick buck.<br />
<br />
So be careful.  We are all in this together.  For the long haul.<br />
<br />
