<p><img src="/images/miscellaneous.jpg" width=110 height=110 align="left" style="margin:0 15px;">Please note that as of January 1, 2009, lithium ion batteries over 100Wh are classified as Class 9 Dangerous Goods.  RED BRICK batteries are 140Wh and therefore fall into this category.  RED will be complying with the rules and regulations set forth as far as documentation, shipping, and handling procedures.  Since there is a Dangerous Goods surcharge for lithium ion batteries added onto the normal cost of shipping, the cost of RED's shipping and handling will be increased accordingly on orders including RED BRICKS.</p>
<p>When preparing to ship RED BRICKS yourself, please note:</p>
<ul>
	<li>You cannot pack more than 3x BRICKS per box.  If you are shipping more than 3x BRICKS, you need to use multiple boxes within the shipment with a maximum of 3x BRICKS per box.</li>
	<li>You must pack sufficiently to withstand a 2m drop.  Do not pack BRICKS against the sides of the box.</li>
	<li>You must complete all <a href="/downloads/shippersdeccol.pdf">required paperwork</a>.</li>
	<li>You must place <a href="/downloads/batterylabel.doc">Lithium Battery Label</a> from IATA DG Regulations, 50th Edition Figure 7.4I.  Place label on the box in clear view and do not cover it with anything. </li>
	<li>You must declare you batteries.   If you ship without declaring and a incident occurs, you will be held liable.</li>
</ul>

<p>RED recommends that you seek the assistance of a Dangerous Goods, Class 9-certified shipper to assist you with your shipment that includes RED BRICKS.  RED hopes that the above guidelines help you in preparing a shipment that includes lithium ion batteries, but also urges you to look into the formal rules and regulations of shipping Class 9 Dangerous goods prior to preparing your shipment.</p>
