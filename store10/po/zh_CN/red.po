"RED’s privacy and security measures are designed with deep bunker security "
"in mind, so any personal information that you provide to RED is used for the "
"purpose of personalizing and enhancing your web experience with RED, and for "
"no other purpose. RED’s specific privacy policies are outlined below.\n"
"\n"
"h2. The Information We Collect\n"
"\n"
"There are three ways that RED obtains information from you: (1) via signup "
"on RED’s website; (2) from an on-line purchase; or (3) navigational "
"information about where visitors go on our website.\n"
"\n"
"h2. How We Use The Information\n"
"\n"
"The information obtained from registration on-line is utilized to improve "
"your web experience with RED by enabling you to obtain a faster checkout for "
"purchases and/or opt-in to receive occasional e-mails, which provide you "
"with the latest and greatest information regarding RED and its products.\n"
"\n"
"The information we ask for when you order on-line is your name, address, "
"phone number, credit card number and email address, and is used only to "
"complete the order, to confirm the order and to confirm shipment of the "
"order. You may, upon placement of an order, opt to allow RED to save the "
"information for a speedier checkout process the next time. This information "
"is then stored only for the purposes of faster checkout and is not used for "
"any other purpose.\n"
"\n"
"The navigational information allows us to see which areas of our Web site "
"are most visited and helps us improve the quality of your online experience "
"by recognizing and delivering more of the most desired features and "
"services. Additional non-personally identifiable information (for example, "
"browser version, IP address) may be collected which will provide information "
"regarding the general use of our website.\n"

"RED will never sell any information about you to anyone. \"Cookies\" are "
"used by RED only to allow you to use RED’s web site in the most efficient "
"manner.\n"
"\n"
"h2. E-Mail\n"
"\n"
"RED will only send e-mails to you if you ask for them and you can easily "
"unsubscribe at any time you want. RED has a company policy not to flood "
"people with e-mail correspondence, but simply gives you periodic information "
"so you can stay up to date on what RED is offering. RED also uses your e-"
"mail address to confirm your order and to confirm shipment of your order and "
"to respond to any inquiries you make on-line. All e-mails you receive will "
"provide you with information as to how to get off the e-mail mailing list if "
"you so desire.\n"
"\n"
"h2. Children’s Privacy\n"
"\n"
"Use RED.com only with involvement of a parent or guardian. Although RED does "
"not specifically direct its web site to children, RED strives to provide "
"children with as much customer service as possible without violating their "
"privacy rights. For their protection, RED asks that anyone under 14 years of "
"age not attempt to register with RED or otherwise provide RED with any "
"personal information without the consent of a parent or legal guardian.\n"
"\n"
"h2. Access To Your Personal Information\n"
"\n"
"RED will provide you with access to the personal information you provided to "
"RED by allowing you to view, update or correct your information. In order to "
"protect your privacy, RED takes steps to verify your identity before "
