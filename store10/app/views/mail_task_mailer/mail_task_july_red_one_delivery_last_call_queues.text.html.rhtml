        <p>With release versions of Build 16, REDCINE (both PC and Mac), and RED Alert! quickly approaching – plus the SDK being released to the community, we feel that the RED ONE is now suitable to be called a “production camera”. That being said, reservation holders in the serial number range of #501 - #1000 will have until September 1 to make the decision whether to pay the balance and take delivery of their RED ONE - or get their deposit refunded and lose their serial number. Should you decide to take delivery of your RED ONE, RED will deliver your RED ONE no later than October 1, 2008.</p>
        <p>We feel very strongly that we have listened to the community and have been very fair about allowing customers to delay delivery. But, simply put, we need to know who is in and who is out so we can better plan our production schedule. After we have finished with #501-#1000 we will then look to #1001-#1500 - and so on.</p>
        <p>We appreciate everyone's patience and continue to look forward to delivering "surprise capabilities" for the RED ONE going forward.</p>

        Thanks,<br />
