CORRECTION: This email also applies to customers who ordered on RED.com and clicked "Accept" on the Terms and Conditions that stated a 6-month RED ONE warranty period.  Your RED ONE warranty period is indeed 1-year, per the current Terms and Conditions.

Begin forwarded message:
> NOTE: By attending either RED DAY or by taking delivering of your camera after RED DAY, you signed REDâ€™s Terms and Conditions.  In the version you received, it lists the RED ONE new camera warranty policy term as 6-months.  It is indeed 1-year (as it currently states online).  The 1-year policy will be honored for your camera(s).
